# MaskDection
## - Machine Learning Project
### Problem Statement
As mask regulations continue to evolve it is more important than ever for governments and businesses to recognize individuals following and not following the appropriate safety guidelines. Based thereon, our goals was to create a solution to better enable the aforementioned stakeholders to identify which individuals are and are not wearing masks. 


### Approach summary
Using haar cascade to detect faces
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001.
- It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images.
- Used to detect objects in other images.
- We used a Haar Cascade Model trained to detect faces in order to obtain the bounding box coordinates of faces in an image.
Deep Learning techniques are applied in this project including CNN, MobileNet, and VGG. Models were compared with accuracy metrics.
